name: Using CSS in HTML
theory: |

  CSS is not directly related to HTML. You need to tell the browser where to download and interpret the styles from. There are three ways to do this:

  1. Specify styles as a value of the `style` attribute. This is called an "inline" entry, which means you need to write the rule on one line using the `style` attribute
  2. Use the special `<style>` tag which is given in the `head` section. The browser will treat everything written inside this tag as CSS code
  3. Add a separate file with styles. In this case, a file with the extension `.css` will be created, within which CSS rules are written. To add the file, use the meta tag `<link>`

  In this lesson, we'll look at the principle of inline style writing with the `style` attribute. Whichever way you choose to add styles, the syntax of the rules remains the same: `name-property: value;`. It is important not to forget to add the `;` symbol after the property value. This allows the browser to separate the rules from each other.

  One of the main ways to "try" styles is to work with text. CSS allows you to style text in a multitude of ways, such as increasing the font size, defining boldness, thickness, and so on. All the basic rules for working with text are covered throughout the course.

  We'll learn how to change fonts. You can change the size by using the `font-size` property, whose value is a number and a unit. Let's try to make the text _32 pixels_. The unit of measure pixel is indicated by the abbreviation `px`. We'll explain more about the different units of measure and how they work in the following lessons

  ```html
  <p style="font-size: 32px;">Large text</p>
  ```

  <div class="hexlet-basics-example my-3 bg-light">
    <p class="m-0" style="font-size: 32px;">Large text</p>
  </div>

instructions: |
  Add the `<p></p>` tag to the editor and use the `style` attribute to set the font size to 12 pixels
