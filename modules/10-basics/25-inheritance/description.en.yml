name: Style inheritance
theory: |
  When you use styles in CSS, it often affects not only the element for which the style is specified but also the tags attached to it. Such styles are called **inherited** styles. The `font-size` style from the last lesson is inherited - it will apply to all nested tags.

  ```html
  <div style="font-size: 20px;">
    The text's font size is 20 pixels.

    <p>The nested paragraph will also have a font size of 20 pixels.</p>
  </div>
  ```

  <div class="hexlet-basics-example my-3 bg-light" style="font-size: 20px;">
    The text's font size is 20 pixels.
    <p class="mb-0">The nested paragraph will also have a font size of 20 pixels.</p>
  </div>

  In addition to the styles that are inherited for all nested tags, CSS has many styles that are unique to the element to which they are applied.

  One such property is `border`, which allows you to set a border around the element. But that same frame won't be copied for every internal element.

  ```html
  <div style="border: 2px solid #000;">
    The block will have a border with a width of 2 pixels

    <p>And the paragraph will not have its own border. If necessary, it can be set separately</p>
    <p style="border: 1px solid #000;">For example, like this</p>
  </div>
  ```

  <div class="hexlet-basics-example my-3 bg-light" style="border: 2px solid #000!important;">
    The block will have a border with a width of 2 pixels
    <p>And the paragraph will not have its own border. If necessary, it can be set separately</p>
    <p style="border: 1px solid #000;" class="mb-0">For example, like this</p>
  </div>

instructions: |
  Add the `<div></div>` tag to the editor and, using the attributes, set the font size to 20 pixels. Inside the `<div>` tag, enclose a paragraph with a font size of 10 pixels
