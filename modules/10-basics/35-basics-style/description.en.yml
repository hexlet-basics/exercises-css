name: Basic tag styles
theory: |
  By default, all HTML tags have a standard layout. This design is set by browsers, and each browser can set its own style. Because of this, the same layout may appear different, depending on the browser, operating system, and system settings.

  For example, the first level header `<h1>` in browsers has a size of `2em`, which means _twice the size of the font in the block_. This value is not fixed - it can change with system settings, or if the browser developers decide to make it slightly different.

  Using the `<style>` tag, we've learned to change styles for all elements at once, for example:

  ```css
  h1 {
    font-size: 35px;
  }
  ```

  But this option is convenient only for setting the initial/main values for our web page. Different parts of it may need different header styles for the same level. We'll learn how to solve this problem using CSS selectors and HTML attributes in future lessons. The main thing to remember is that almost all elements have a default style, which can be both a benefit and a nuisance when designing a page

instructions: |
  Add a first level heading to the editor and set the font size to 20 pixels. Write the styles in the `<style>` tag.
