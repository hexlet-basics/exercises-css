name: Classes
theory: |
  The main solution for styling a particular part of the page is to use classes. They allow us to set a style we need only for the elements that have the required class satisfied, rather than all of them.

  To specify a style for a class in CSS, we use the selector `.name-class'. Note the dot, this is how the browser understands that this style is specified for the class.

  ```html
  <p class="paragraph">
    The text of our paragraph.
    It's the paragraph class in CSS that
    will set properties for this block of text.
  </p>
  ```

  ```css
  .paragraph {
    color: #333333;
    /*
      The color property sets the color of the text.
      In this case, it is gray with a value of #333333
    */
  }
  ```

  Since there can be many classes with the same name on the page, this rule will work for all elements where the class attribute is `paragraph`

instructions: |
  In the editor, add a paragraph with the class set to news and specify a text color of `#553333` for it. Add styles with the `<style>` tag.
