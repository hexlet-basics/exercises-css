  Coloring a section of text is a common way to get a user's attention on a page. Various advertising banners are constantly trying to tell us about an incredible discount, or an offer that ends today. In the same way, highlighting can indicate important information that must be read.

  Using CSS, you can set the color of the text for the whole page or for a small area. This is determined by the selector you choose. The color itself is set using the property `color`, the value of which is, naturally, a color.

  In this lesson, the color will be written in `HEX` format, where `#ffffff` means white and `#000000` means black. For convenience, there'll be a link to a portal at the end of the lesson, where you can select any color and get its value in `HEX` format. We'll talk more about color models in CSS in a future lesson.

  Create a paragraph and color one word in it. To do this, let's wrap it in a `<span>` string tag and give it a class, which we'll use to select the CSS element:

  ```html
  <p><span class="info">Attention!</span> Important information</p>
  ```

  ```css
  .info {
    color: #5263f3;
  }
  ```

  <div class="hexlet-basics-example my-3">
    <p class="m-0"><span style="color:#5263f3;">Attention!</span> Important information</p>
  </div>

  If you want to set the text color for an entire page, you can use the `body` selector. The `color` property is inherited, so the color will be set for all text elements:

  ```css
  body {
    color: #333333;
  }
  ```

instructions: |
  In the editor, add a `<span>` element with the class set to `violet`, and set its color to `#9400d3`. Use the `<style>` tag to include styles.

  - You can select a color and get its `hex` code at [HTML Color Codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/)
