name: Font size
theory: |

  Another way to separate sections of text is to use different font sizes. We've already seen that browsers style headings differently. It's the size of the text that separates the `<h1>` header from the `<h2>` header and so on.

  You can control the size of the text in CSS by using the `font-size` property, which takes a numeric value and a unit of measure. For now, we'll use pixels as the unit of measurement, although there are a few other important units you'll have learned by the end of this course.

  ```html
  <p>Warning, this paragraph has the standard font size</p>
  <p class="warning">This paragraph has a font size of 24 pixels</p>
  ```

  ```css
  .warning {
    font-size: 24px;
  }
  ```

  <div class="hexlet-basics-example my-3">
    <p>Warning, this paragraph has the standard font size</p>
    <p class="m-0" style="font-size: 24px;">Notice! This paragraph has a font size of 24 pixels</p>
  </div>

instructions: |
  Add a paragraph to the editor with the class set to `big` and set the font size to 60 pixels. Add styles to the `<style>` tag
