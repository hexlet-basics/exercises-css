name: Small caps
theory: |
  Small caps are a type of lowercase letter whose size is the same as (or close to) the size of capital letters.

  <div class="hexlet-basics-example my-3">
    <p>Text typed as plain text</p>
    <p style="font-variant: small-caps" class="m-0">Text with small caps</p>
  </div>

  This is often used as a stylistic device. But there is also a practical side to small caps: they are commonly used to mark abbreviations, and they are also used in the first lines of a piece of text to make it easier for the reader to get into the text after the title.

  To set small caps, use the `font-variant` property with one of two basic values:

  * `normal` - normal writing
  * `small-caps` - small caps

instructions: |
  Add a paragraph to the editor with the class set to `small-capitals` and display the text inside as capitals. Add styles to the `<style>` tag
