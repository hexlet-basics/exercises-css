  <u>Underlining</u> is often used to boost text. It shows the importance of the current word or text (and it's also often used to show links in a document). Another means of styling text is to use <s>strike-through</s> to show a piece of text that is wrong, e.g., "Don't do this <s>or that</s>."

  The `text-decoration` property with three basic properties is used for this kind of text modification:

  * `underline` - <u>underline text</u>
  * `strike-through` - <s>Redraw text</s>
  * `overline` - <span style="text-decoration: overline;">overline text</span>

  The `none` value is used to remove underscores from links. This is often used to remove the underscore from links, which are there by default

  ```html
  <a href="#">Ordinary link underlined by default</a>
  <a href="#" class="text-decoration-none">Non-underlined link</a>
  ```

  ```css
  .text-decoration-none {
    text-decoration: none;
  }
  ```

  <div class="hexlet-basics-example my-3">
    <a href="#" class="d-block mb-3">Ordinary link with underscore by default</a>
    <a href="#" style="text-decoration: none">link without underscore</a>
  </div>

instructions: |
  Add a paragraph with the class set to `line` to the editor and set it to have underlined text. Add styles to the `<style>` tag
