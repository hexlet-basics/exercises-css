name: Line height
theory: |
  Line height (interline spacing) is important when working with text. This parameter determines how much space there will be between lines.

  | Insufficient line spacing                                      | Optimal line height                                        |
  |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | <p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 14px">Text with a font size of 14 pixels and 14-pixel line height</p> | <p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;">Text with a font size of 14 pixels and 21 pixel line height</p> |

  Note that the left-hand text is harder to read. This is due to the fact that your eyes don't stay on one line, rather they constantly move between them.

  To set the line height, we use the `line-height` property. The value is a number and a unit of measure. As with setting font size, you can use different units of measurement, but in this course we'll use pixels. Other units of measure will be explored later

instructions: |
  Add a paragraph to the editor with the class set to `line-height` with a font size of 24 pixels and a line spacing of 36 pixels. Add styles to the `<style>` tag.

  Try adding long phrases to the paragraph and adjusting the line height to see how it affects readability
