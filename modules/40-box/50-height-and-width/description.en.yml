name: Block height and width
theory: |
  When you create pages, you often want to control the height and width of blocks. This is useful in long articles when you want to put explanatory text in a small block. This way it will be separated from the main part of the text, and you can see it immediately.

  The rules `width` and `height` are used to control the height and width of block elements, taking values for width and height respectively (in pixels or other available units of measure, for example).

  Let's create a block 100 pixels high and 100 pixels wide. To visually separate it from the theory in the tutorial, set the background color to black:

  ```html
  <style>
    .square {
      width: 100px;
      height: 100px;
      background-color: #000;
    }
  </style>

  <div class="square"></div>
  ```

  <div class="hexlet-basics-example my-3">
    <div style="width: 100px; height: 100px; background-color: #000;"></div>
  </div>

instructions: |
  Add `<div>` to the editor with the class set to `rectangle`. Set the properties:

  * Width: 300px
  * Height: 100px
  * Background color: `#000`.

  Write the styles in the `<style>` tag
